# 📌 To-Do List Project 📝

A simple **To-Do List application** built in Python with both **CLI (Command Line)** and **GUI (Tkinter)** versions.  
This project helps manage daily tasks with options to add, delete, view, and mark tasks as completed.  
Tasks are stored in a `tasks.txt` file so they remain saved even after closing the program.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks  
- ✅ View all tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as Completed

- ✅ Persistent storage (`tasks.txt`)
